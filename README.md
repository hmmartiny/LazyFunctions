# LazyFunctions
Functions that I'll probably reuse a bunch of times, so I'll be lazy and save them.

## Structure
Saved the functions in a file structure according to what application they might be used in.

**Dictionary**: for easily working with dict structures

**PyTorch**: functions for extending any work made with PyTorch.
